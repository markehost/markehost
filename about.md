My name is Mark, I am a front-end developer.  I am an expert at CSS and JavaScript.  

I grew up in Syracuse, NY.  Went to university in the Bronx.  Lived in Omaha, Nebraska for 4 years then Queens, NY.  Now I call Maine home.

I went to school for finance hoping to be the next Warren Buffett and along the way I found web development to be more satisfying and challenging.
