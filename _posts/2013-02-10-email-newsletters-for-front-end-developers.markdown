Email has gotten a bad name for itself over the last decade.  Spammers, phishers and Nigerian Princes have mastered it.  Even Facebook now has their own version of email.

I like it email, so long as it's heavily filtered using Gmail filters and used solely for pushed content that I want to receive.  RSS is a great way to keep up on your favorite content but it can be burdensome to make sure you have all the right content.  If you signup for the right email newsletters, that's all done for you.  You may have to endure a few ads, but the content selection is superior rather than filtering it yourself.

### Javascript &amp; Programming

* [Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/) - A great weekly resource for staying on top of JS news and libraries.
* [Daily JS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/dailyjs) - Ditto.  A short bite-sized helping of JS every day.  Very useful. 
* [Status Code](http://statuscode.org/) - A pure programming newsletter from the Javascript Weekly curator.


### Web Related

* [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/about/rss) - A web magazine at the forefront of web technologies with many ground-breaking articles like the one that started the [Responsive Design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) fad.
* [HTML5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/) - A good collection of news, proof of concepts and tutorials.
* [Alertbox from Jakob Nielsen](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/subscribe/) - The authority is user experience research, infrequent easy to read emails. Worth every email.
* [SEOMox Top Ten](http://www.seomoz.org/moztop10) - Monthly newsletter outlining interesting stories in the world of search.
* [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/) - Though, I don't recommend all their content, it's a nice source to keep in touch on breadth of topics and includes some outside links.
* [Webdesigner Depot](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/newsletter/) - I hesitate to put this on the list, but it can be helpful for free resources like icon sets and an occassional helpful article.



### News

Because every developer should be in touch with current events.

* [NextDraft](http://nextdraft.com/) - by Dave Pell, one of my favorite emails to receive with good news stories and other interesting bits.  Also has [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nextdraft-days-most-fascinating/id549358690).
* [NPR](http://www.npr.org/templates/reg/) - Bad part, you need to create an account, good part, you can tailor your content to your interests.
* [National Geographic](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/newsletter) Like NPR, you can tailor the content to your taste.  I only subscribe to the Photo Buff Newsletters since everything else is just too much.  

### Extra 

[Now I Know](http://nowiknow.com/) is a newsletter that details something random every day.  Can be very interesting or sent to the delete box immediately.  If you have a few minutes to read something new every day, this is a good newsletter.
