My name is Mark, I am a front-end developer and an expert at CSS and JavaScript (along with the many libraries and tools).    

I grew up in Syracuse, NY.  Went to Fordham University in the Bronx.  Lived in Omaha, Nebraska for 4 years then Queens, NY for another 4 years.  Now I call Maine my home.

I went to school for finance hoping to be the next Warren Buffett and along the way I found web development to be more satisfying and challenging.

You can email me at **me -at- markho.st**, DM me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/markehost/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/markehost) at **@markehost**, and of course, [Github](https://github.com/markehost).
